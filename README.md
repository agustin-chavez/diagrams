# ✏️ Diagrams 

###  My System Architecture Designs

This repository contains diagrams that illustrate the architecture of various popular systems like Spotify, Netflix, Twitter, Google Drive, Youtube, Instagram, TikTok, etc.

The diagrams are created using  https://www.draw.io/ and showcase the architecture in multiple pages, capturing each iteration or decision point taken during the design process. Each page is marked with the version number.

This provides a deeper understanding of the architectural evolution and trade-offs involved.
