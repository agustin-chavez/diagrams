# ✏️ Diagrams 

###  My System Architecture Designs

This repository contains diagrams that illustrate the architecture of various popular systems like Spotify, Netflix, Twitter, Youtube, TikTok, etc.

The diagrams are created using  https://www.draw.io/ and showcase the architecture in multiple pages, capturing each iteration or decision point taken during the design process. Each page is marked with the version number. This provides a deeper understanding of the architectural evolution and trade-offs involved.
